    <h3>How to cook:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Make the marinade:</strong> In a large plastic bag, add beef, salt and pepper and toss until the meat is coated.
        <br> Add the brown sugar, olive oil, sesame oil, red wine vinegar, soy sauce and whole grain mustard. 
        <br>Toss until coated. Chill for at least 30 minutes, preferably 4 hours.</li>
      <p><li>Heat up a grill. Alternatively, heat a grill pan over medium high heat.</li></p>
      <p><li>Soak kabob skewers in water for 30 minutes. Remove beef from the marinade and shake off any excess liquid, reserving the marinade.</li></p>
      <p><li>Thread beef, onion, bell pepper and pineapple onto skewers as desired.</li></p>
      <li>Place the kabobs on the grill and brush with some of the reserved marinade. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.
        <br> Flip the kabobs over after 5 minutes and brush on the rest of the marinade.
        <br> Cover and cook another 5 minutes for medium rare or continue to cook until desired doneness.</li>
